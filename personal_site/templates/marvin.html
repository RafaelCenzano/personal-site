Version 4 has a Flask app for the GUI and utilizes more advanced coding techniques to make code more efficient. It has been developed a ton on certain features but there is still much work to be done to regain and refactor past features of Marvin projects.</a>

I refactored a huge amount of the code and created many new features. It was a great success and allowed me to learn new strategies for coding and python code. It is on the inefficient side due to putting together code from many different sources.</a>
